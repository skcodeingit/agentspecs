goal: "To provide a central registry for prompts, enforce safety guardrails, track prompt feedback, and enable agents to reuse high-quality prompts across solutions."

perception: "This server understands prompts, responses, user intent, guardrails, application context, and can suggest or filter prompts automatically."

capabilities:
  - "Store prompts and responses automatically from GHCP Agent Mode"
  - "Retrieve prompts by applicationId, domain, tags, or solution nature"
  - "Like/dislike prompts for ranking and training feedback"
  - "Guardrail scanning for unsafe, disallowed, or non-compliant prompts"
  - "Prompt suggestion based on application context and historical behavior"
  - "Prompt versioning and audit logs"
  - "OpenAI-powered semantic prompt matching"
  - "MCP-compatible tool definitions for prompt access and mutation"

performance:
  accuracy: "98% for semantic prompt matching"
  speed: "5-20 ms for retrieval"
  reliability: "99.99% for prompt read/write operations"
